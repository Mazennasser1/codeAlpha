Artificial Intelligence 
Since the 1950s, scientists and engineers have designed computers to "think" by making decisions and finding patterns like humans do. In recent years, artificial intelligence has become increasingly powerful, propelling discovery across scientific fields and enabling researchers to delve into problems previously too complex to solve. Outside of science, artificial intelligence is built into devices all around us, and billions of people across the globe rely on it every day. Stories of artificial intelligence—from friendly humanoid robots to SkyNet—have been incorporated into some of the most iconic movies and books.

But where is the line between what AI can do and what is make-believe? How is that line blurring, and what is the future of artificial intelligence? At Caltech, scientists and scholars are working at the leading edge of AI research, expanding the boundaries of its capabilities and exploring its impacts on society. Discover what defines artificial intelligence, how it is developed and deployed, and what the field holds for the future.
